# GAN-Based Image Generation

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic images from random noise. The GAN consists of a generator that creates fake images and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and fake images. Both networks are trained in an adversarial setting, with the generator improving over time to produce more realistic outputs. While early results may appear noisy, further training can enhance the quality of generated images.
