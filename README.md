# GAN-Based Image Generation

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic images from random noise. The GAN consists of:

Generator: Generates fake images.
Discriminator: Classifies images as real or fake.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gan-image-generation.git
cd gan-image-generation
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Training the GAN:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Generate Images:
bash
Copy code
python generate.py --checkpoint models/generator_epoch_5.pth
Visualize Results:
Generated images are saved in images/. You can plot them with:

bash
Copy code
python visualize.py
Results
Epoch 1:

Epoch 5:

Future Work
Train for more epochs for better results.
Try different GAN variants (e.g., WGAN).
Experiment with higher-resolution datasets.
